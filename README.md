# BMI Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to the BMI Calculator project! This project showcases the implementation of various advanced concepts in Swift, including Optionals, the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, and the use of Classes. The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of these concepts and demonstrate their application in a practical, functional application.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to:

- Effectively utilize Optionals.
- Solidify knowledge of the MVC design pattern.
- Introduce and work with Classes in Swift.
- Compare and contrast objects created from classes with instances of structs.

## What I Created

In this project, I developed a functional Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. This calculator allows users to input their weight and height, calculate their BMI, and receive health advice based on the calculated BMI. The advice varies from suggesting they might have eaten too many pies to encouraging them to eat more pies.

## Learning Outcomes

### Multi-Screen Apps with Animated Navigation

- Created an application with multiple screens.
- Implemented smooth and visually appealing animated transitions between screens.

### Optionals

- Gained a deeper understanding of Optionals in Swift.
- Implemented optional binding, optional chaining, and the nil coalescing operator.
- Ensured the safe handling of optional values to prevent runtime errors.

### Classes and Structs

- Defined and used classes in Swift.
- Explored the differences between classes and structs:
  - Classes support inheritance, reference counting, and can be deinitialized.
  - Structs are value types, whereas classes are reference types.

### Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference

- Understood the concept of passing data by value versus by reference.
- Learned the implications of each method and when to use them.

### String Formatting

- Learned how to format strings for displaying BMI results and health advice.

### Color Literals

- Utilized color literals in Swift to enhance the user interface of the app.

## Getting Started

To explore this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Review the implementation to understand how each feature was built.
4. Run the application on the iOS Simulator or an iOS device to test its functionality.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive understanding of Optionals, the MVC design pattern, and Classes in Swift. The resulting BMI calculator application showcases the practical application of these concepts, highlighting the learning and coding skills involved in its creation.
